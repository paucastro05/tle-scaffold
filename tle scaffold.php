“At Odds with the Pervasive Toxin”
</h1>
<center>
<p><br>If COVID is reality, can we really bare it?</br>
<br>Children hiding and people dying,</br>
<br>Insufficient health regulations,</br>
<br>Can we really take the risk of going out?</p></br>

<br><p>Having this new normal, seems absolutely wrong</br>
<br>Wearing masks, face shields feels uncomfortable</br>
<br>Even this online distant learning</br>
<br>Everything just doesn’t seem so right</br></p>

<br><p>Viruses spreading throughout the nation</br>
<br>Affecting our way of living and surviving</br>
<br>Damaging our lives in any possible way</br>
<br>Slaughtering those who are dear to us</br></p>
<br><p>Population becoming less and ended up empty</br>
<br>Are we really going to end up dying due to this COVID?</br>
<br>Would be our future going to end up lock up by this disease?</br>
<br>Or would there still be a hope for us.</br></p>
